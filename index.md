## About Me


<img class="profile-picture" src="IMG_8400.PNG"> 

Hi! I am Terry ðŸ˜Š, a researcher at the University of Sydney. I major in deep learning at the school of computer science.
I am interested in applying advanced deep learning methods into software engineering and recommendation system.

**Research Field**: NLP/NLU, Multi-Modalities, Software Engineering, Educational Data Mining. I also have rich experience on image and video data processing during the industry internship.

**Recent Work**: Cooperate with teammates to build an AI search engine for the neural network.

Find out more at my [[CV]](CV.pdf).

<!-- Before coming to Peking University in 2017, I studied at Tongji University.

The copyright of the code belongs to the commercial authority and cannot be open source. If you are interested, the demo can be provided as a display. |
The project fully embodies a trade-off balance of accuracy and user experience. Users get better experience by the design of detecting the sensitivity of the affine transformation function.
